# Powershell

1.) Pull_all_OU_members


    For this script you will have to change a couple of lines.
      Get-ADGroup -Filter 'Name -like "*"' -SearchBase "OU=<CUSTOM_OU_HERE>, DC=<YOUR_DC_HERE>, DC=com"
      C:\Users\Administrator.... (obviously a different file path.)

More scripts to hopefully come in the future.
